# A script to demonstrate integer object creation in Python

# First line of the script (103-line1.txt)
a = 1024  # A number outside the range of -5 to 256, so a new int object is created

# Second line of the script (103-line2.txt)
b = 1024  # Another new int object is created, even though it's the same value as 'a'

# Printing the IDs to show whether they are the same object or different
print(f"ID of a: {id(a)}")
print(f"ID of b: {id(b)}")
